# Welcome to the GitHub Project Management repository
:tada:

This repository was created as a resource for folks learning how to use GitHub as a collaborative project management tool. :octocat:

Here are a few resources to help you right off the bat:
* Glossary: https://github.com/joeyklee/friendly-github-intro/blob/master/glossary.md 
* GitHub Lingo Pt1 quiz: http://bit.ly/ghlingo1 
* Markdown cheat sheet: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet 
* Emoji cheat sheet: http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/

### Go ahead and fork this so you can add a copy to your own account.

* Fork this repo
  * Click the "Fork" button in the top right of this page
  * Check to make sure you're on your own forked version of this repo (look for your username as part of the path in the top left).
* Edit this README
  * Click the README.md file. 
  * Click the pencil icon to edit.
  * Use this [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and make edits.  Add text, delete text (though I'd recommend not changing these instructions), [add emojis](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/). Have fun!
* Save and publish your changes
  * Scroll down and complete the information in the "Commit changes" box. 
  * Add a note about what you changed. This is an important part of version control â€” it allows other people (and even your future self!) to know what changes you made and why. 

When you are done, click on the [EXERCISES](/EXERCISES/) folder and follow the instructions in the RetirementParty.md.
